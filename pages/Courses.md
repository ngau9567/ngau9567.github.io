### <a name="course1" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/SEAS6401.html">SEAS 6401 - Data Analytics Foundations & Practicum</a>
*by Prof. Benjamin Harvey*
##### Course Description
Introduction to concepts and techniques in data analytics. Basic techniques of data science; algorithms for data mining; basics of statistical modeling and their “Big Data” applications. Concepts, abstractions, and practical techniques. Restricted to students in the MS in data analytics program.

---

### <a name="course2" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6574.html">EMSE 6574 - Programming for Analytics</a>
*by Prof. Maksim Tsvetovat*
##### Course Description
Introduction to programming for data analytics using the Python programming language. Prepares students for higher-level courses in data analytics. Recommended background: Some prior experience with programming.

### <a name="course6" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6575.html">EMSE 6575 - Applied Machine Learning for Analytics</a>
*by Prof. Maksim Tsvetovat*
##### Course Description
Methods and techniques for discovering patterns and relationships in aggregated data, with practical focus on engineering problems. Tools, techniques, and methods explored in the context of their application.

---

### <a name="course5" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6586.html">EMSE 6586 - DBMS for Data Analytics</a>
*by Prof. Joel Klein*
##### Course Description
Study and design of database and data management systems for big data and data analytics; design of relational database systems and the SQL query language; NoSQL databases for unstructured data, including key-value, distributed table, graph databases, parallel processing databases. 

---

### <a name="course4" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6765.html">EMSE 6765 - Data Analysis for Engineering & Science</a>
*Prof. J. Rene Van Dorp*
##### Course Description
<p>Probability and Statistical review is provided in the first three to three lectures. Statistical Inference topics that will be discussed include estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and goodness-of-fit testing. These methods perform statistical inference in a single dimension (also known as univariate data analysis).</p>
<p>Discussions of multivariate data analysis utilize matrices and vectors. One class will review rules of matrix-vector algebra and provides some intuitive geographical interpretations of these operations. Multivariate data analysis will be introduced by first discussing the classical Hotelling T2 hypothesis test, which is a natural extension of the univariate T test.</p>
<p>Next, the class introduces regression nalysis (in matrix-vector format) and principal component analysis. The introduction of these topics will be cursory and their application will be facilitated by the use of the MINITAB software program. Discussion of these multivariate techniques will concentrate on intuition, not a rigorous derivation of their methodologies.</p>

### <a name="course7" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6765.html">CSCI 6444 - Intro to Big Data and Analytics</a>
*Prof. Stephen H. Kaisler*
##### Course Description
<p>This course is an introductory course that will cover a lot of topics in Big Data and Analytics.</p>
<p>The objectives are:</p>
<ul>
       <li>To introduce students to some of the concepts, issues and challenges in dealing with Big Data.</li>
       <li>To examine the types of analytics and work with a few of the tools to process some relatively Big Data sets.</li>
       <li>To understand the type of advanced analytics beyond simple statistical analysis, data mining, and statistical machine learning which address complex problems facing business, society, science and engineering today.</li>
       <li>To describe the roles of data scientist and analytic scientist</li>
       <li>To practice some of the techniques through class projects.</li>
</ul>
