### <a name="course5" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6586.html">EMSE 6586 - DBMS for Data Analytics</a>

##### Course Description
Study and design of database and data management systems for big data and data analytics; design of relational database systems and the SQL query language; NoSQL databases for unstructured data, including key-value, distributed table, graph databases, parallel processing databases. 

---

### <a name="course4" href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/EMSE6765.html">EMSE 6765 - Data Analysis for Engineering & Science</a>

##### Course Description
<p>Probability and Statistical review is provided in the first three to three lectures. Statistical Inference topics that will be discussed include estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and goodness-of-fit testing. These methods perform statistical inference in a single dimension (also known as univariate data analysis).</p>
<p>Discussions of multivariate data analysis utilize matrices and vectors. One class will review rules of matrix-vector algebra and provides some intuitive geographical interpretations of these operations. Multivariate data analysis will be introduced by first discussing the classical Hotelling T2 hypothesis test, which is a natural extension of the univariate T test.</p>
<p>Next, the class introduces regression nalysis (in matrix-vector format) and principal component analysis. The introduction of these topics will be cursory and their application will be facilitated by the use of the MINITAB software program. Discussion of these multivariate techniques will concentrate on intuition, not a rigorous derivation of their methodologies.</p>
