####  <a name="emse6574-assignment1"></a>Assignment 1
##### Assignment Description 
"Palindrome" script -- take any string, and find out if it is a palindrome -- does it read backward the same as forward?
Create a huge dataset of fake data (or real data) using a list of dicts as a data structure
1 Iterate through that list; if a record matches some condition, print it.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment2"></a>Assignment 2
##### Assignment Description 
Convert the tree class to a graph class.
A graph can have as many "child nodes" to a parent node as you want (in a graph we don't call them "child nodes", they're "neighbors")
You can have loops -- a node can point back to its parents / grandparents / etc
Write a depth first traversal of a graph starting at any random node -- you stop and backtrack when you hit a leaf node, or when you hit a node you've already visited
Write a breadth-first traversal of a graph starting at any random node
Example = simple social network. Pick a book or a movie, characters are nodes, edges mean "friends with"

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment3"></a>Assignment 3
##### Assignment Description 
Do analysis on the FEC dataset: 
Go "spelunking" and see what you can find -- find some celebrities? Who did they donate to?
Find some major corporations -- can you learn about their political strategy?
BONUS POINTS -- you wrote a graph data structure in part 1: see if you can fit this data into your data structure
Straw donors -- that's when your boss tells you to donate to X, and reimburses you

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment4"></a>Assignment 4
##### Assignment Description 
Analyze on two different dataset, `m_data` and `w_data`. And by running analysis on the datasets to know what is the data telling us? There were two groups: a contol group and a test group. The test group was told some additional information on the dataset.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment5"></a>Assignment 5
##### Assignment Description 
we go through the dataset and notebook of [https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/ml-from-scratch-with-iris](https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/ml-from-scratch-with-iris) and try to work on it on our own.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment6"></a>Assignment 6
##### Assignment Description 
Try to conduct machine learning regressors and to predict diamond prices better than the in-class regressor. It should have:
* Fewer errors > $2,500
* Fewer or no errors > 10% of price

The dataset to use is the diamond dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds)).

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment7"></a>Assignment 7
##### Assignment Description 
Apply random forest classifier/regressor on a dataset we found online.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment8"></a>Assignment 8
##### Assignment Description 
Code a genetic algorithm to optimize a particular problem. My problem of choice is the traveling salesman problem - visit all cities in a list in the shortest distance possible without revisiting already visited cities.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment9"></a>Assignment 9
##### Assignment Description 
Pick a stock and download its historical price data. The stock I found is Tesla. I then resample data to weekly and monthly prices. Determine if there's any seasonality and train a SARIMA model on it to try and predict future prices.
